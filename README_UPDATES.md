## How to Use the New Features

### Fine-Tuning the User Model

To enable user-specific language model fine-tuning:

1. Open the AI Companion app
2. Go to Settings > Personalization
3. Enable "Learn from my interactions"
4. Use the app regularly - the model will improve over time
5. To reset learning, use the "Reset Personalization Data" button

### Running Tests

To run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
swift test

# Run specific test suite
swift test --filter TaskPrioritizerTests

# Generate test coverage report
swift test --enable-code-coverage
```

## Future Improvements
